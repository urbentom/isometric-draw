## What is it? 

Just a little fun project where you can draw isometric shapes using the grid, this is just done by filling small triangles in the grid. Go check it out [here](https://isometric.urbentom.uk/)
## Features

Current features include:
- Pick a Fill Colour
- Pick a Colour Pallet
- Fill and Erase colours from the grid
- Hide / Show grid

> Erase is a little buggy at the moment, if you mov your mouse a little in the triangle it should eventually remove the colour. Also avoid colouring over the same triangle as it won't replace the colour.

### Future Features
- Fix buggyness around fill / erase colour in grid
- Add ability to save drawing
- Add ability to create custom pallets
    - Want to look into linking with sites like [colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co/) as they have an amazing library of colour pallets.
